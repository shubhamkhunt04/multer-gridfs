# Multer Gridfs Storage demo

A small, basic demo project to demonstrate the use of multer-gridfs-storage to upload a file and download it.

## Getting Started

Read up a little about Gridfs storage here
[GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/#gridfs)

### Prerequisites

Node.js

### Installing

`npm install`

The project accepts a single file as input. You can change the mutler upload function to anything else. The input to retrieve the file name is the original name of the file. You can change this in the file property in `storage` GridFS Storage object.

## Running the tests

Mocha and Chai have been installed, I haven't added the tests yet. You can use

`npm run test`

to run tests.
